# Xkit-Sample
Sample Code for the Xkit - built for Arduino. The perfect way to get started with Sigfox, the Thinxtra devkit Xkit boasts a full suite of features and accessories to empower anyone to set up an IoT solution, even with very little hardware experience. Perfect for start-ups, design houses, universities and schools, the kit has everything you need to hit the ground running using the globally available Sigfox network. 

## Code Example

The example code can be found in the DemoApp folder.

## Motivation

This project provides library for fast development of Sigfox-based solutions.

## Installation

The libraries should be copied to the location of Arduino libraries on your computer.

## API Reference

The development guide with Xkit using the libraries in this project is given in the Xkit Development Guide at http://www.thinxtra.com/xkit/

## Documents
You can find the schematics of the Xkit in the Documents > Xkit_Schematics.
If you do not want to use our library to send Sigfox message, you can find the AT command list in Documents > Wisol_Command_and_Schematics. AT commands are used to communicate with the Sigfox module (Wisol) on the Xkit. If you refer using the USB port on the XKit for this purpose, please remember to set the jumpers on the Xkit to the USB-use configuration.
